Plumi-Install-Script-for-CentOS6.x-x64
======================================

Shell scripts to aid with the installation of the Plumi video server on "clean" CentOS v6.x 64bit systems only.

There are 3 shell scripts:
CentOS_Plumi-Install.sh
CentOS_Plumi-Prep.sh
CentOS_Plumi-Build.sh

It's highly recommended you run these scripts on a "clean minimal install" of CentOS 6.x. These are simple bash scripts which provide very little event trapping for errors (simply because this is the first time I'm writing bash scripts :P).

However on a clean system, these scripts should get you up and running.

Getting Started
===============
